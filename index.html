          <p>I consider myself to be a work orientated person, who likes to see tasks through to completion and to the highest standard. Recently completed Bsc in chemistry at the University of Southampton, where in my final project I worked under Professor J.W. Essex on a computational research project focusing on the development of coarse-grained forcefields.</p>
          <p>I am now beginning to follow one of my passions and start a career in Tech. My hope for this is that i will be able to better society in some way while continually challenging myself. To achieve this I aim to target bringing more advanced tech to the masses.</p>

      </ul>

      <h5>Final Project</h5>
      <h6>Evaluation of SIRAH - a Coarse-Grained Protein Model; the Validity of the Forcefield in the context of Partition Coefficients</h6>
      <p>Coarse graining is a method for developing a forcefield to model systems in molecular dynamics, and SIRAH is an example of such a forcefield. In this study the validity of this forcefield was investigated for use on modelling proteins by carrying out free energy calculations to determine the octanol - water partition coefficients of amino acid side chains. These were obtained for two different models of octanol, developed using the SIRAH parameters and optimized using ForceBalance. The results for both models showed that currently the SIRAH forcefield could not be validated for use in modelling proteins.</p>
